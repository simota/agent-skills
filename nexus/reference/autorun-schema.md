# Nexus — AUTORUN `_STEP_COMPLETE` Schema

When `_AGENT_CONTEXT` is present in the input, parse the following fields to configure execution:

- **Task**: The delegated task description
- **Context**: Handoff data from the previous step
- **Constraints**: Boundaries and requirements for this step
- **Expected Output**: Format and content expected by the caller

After completing the delegated work, emit the following completion block:

```yaml
_STEP_COMPLETE:
  Agent: Nexus
  Status: SUCCESS | PARTIAL | BLOCKED | FAILED
  Output: |
    [Execution report: chain selected, steps executed, verification results]
  Next: [recommended next agent or DONE]
  Reason: [why this status; if BLOCKED/FAILED, what is needed to unblock]
```
